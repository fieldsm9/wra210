Thus far, I have been able to perfectly separate my content and presentation. I have created a separate html page for every page and created a css document for my course page and my portfolio respectively. I never put any style commands in my html documents. You told us early on not to do this, and Code Academy taught me how not to do this. So, I didn't do it.
