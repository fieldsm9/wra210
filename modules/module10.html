  <h4>Separation</h4>
  <p>
Thus far, I have been able to perfectly separate my content and presentation. I have created a separate html page for every page and created a css document for my course page and my portfolio respectively. I never put any style commands in my html documents. You told us early on not to do this, and Code Academy taught me how not to do this. So, I didn't do it.
</p>
  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>My next steps with this however, is to add alternative text to all of my images so that my code validates. In this way, I wasn't thinking about the content. I should have been thinking about alternative text from the beginning so that my html can be read by all browsers and programs.</p>
