In our scrum team, we spent a lot of time helping each other with code. Links can get confusing and folder organization was a problem for some members in my scrum team. We spent a lot of time trying to organize github files so that they would show up properly.

I worked on most of my portfolio outside of class. I set the goal of having my html done in class and adding css at other times. I achieved this goal, so the first day of scrum my teammates only looked at my html, which they said looked good. It also validated, so I was happy with that.

I used a variety of online resources during this class. Any time I couldn't remember what Code Academy taught me or I needed help, I googled the question until I figured out what I needed. I visited a bunch of random forums and websites, but most often this one: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a>.
