<h4>
  Scrum Experience
  </h4>
  <p>
In our scrum team, we spent a lot of time helping each other with code. Links can get confusing and folder organization was a problem for some members in my scrum team. We spent a lot of time trying to organize github files so that they would show up properly. Casey ended up messing up her github when she tried using the desktop version. Something wasn't quite compatible with her laptop. We ended up fiddling around with all sorts of things until we solved the problem and she understood how to use github. We spent time looking at Tara's css. We helped her with her design choices and her photoshopped images. Meanwhile, my teammates helped me with my html and content of my site. I was confident in my css abilities, I was just have difficulty figuring out what to include and in what ways to present it. We worked off of my wireframes, and they helped me feel better about these design choices. We were all at very different steps for the Scrum process, but we were able to help each other where we could, and all of our portfolios turned out great for our first attempt at building websites.

  Time Management
  </h4>
<p>
I worked on most of my portfolio outside of class. I set the goal of having my html done in class and adding css at other times. I achieved this goal, so the first day of scrum my teammates only looked at my html, which they said looked good. It also validated, so I was happy with that. Like I mentioned earlier, the css seemed easy to me using the 960 grid system, so I spent a lot of time writing my html apart from the css. We ended up eating at Sny-phi a lot, and we'd work on stuff together while we ate. Overall, I think I got my portfolio done in plenty of time for my presentation. This gave me time to make revisions that other classmates suggested and gave me a fresh view outside of my scrum team.

  <h4>
  Resources Used
  </h4>
<p>
I used a variety of online resources during this class. Any time I couldn't remember what Code Academy taught me or I needed help, I googled the question until I figured out what I needed. I visited a bunch of random forums and websites, but most often this one: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a>. This website has every option for every command, and it helped me to remember what sorts of things I can do with CSS. It is definitely the most helpful link I visited. Other random forums provided mixed results. I would look through various opened tabs until I saw something that seemed familiar and went back to w3schools to see what these commands meant. I would definitely reccomend that website to any first-time website builders.
